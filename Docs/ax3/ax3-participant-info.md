# AX3/AX6 Participant Information (Sample)

> This document is a sample of information for study participants.


## What is the AX3/AX6 device?

The AX3/AX6 is a small, lightweight sensing device that is designed to measure physical activity for research studies.  The device is equipped with a movement sensor (an accelerometer and, for the AX6, a gyroscope), internal temperature sensor, and light level indicator.  The device is part of the "Open Movement" project (https://openmovement.dev).  


## What data does it collect?

The device stores data on movement, temperature, and light levels during the interval configured for the study.  The data is stored on the device and will be downloaded by the study team for analysis.  You will be provided with more information on how this data is handled, including the types of analysis that will be performed.


## How do I use the device?

There is no user-interface for the device: it will already be configured for use in the study, and you will only have to follow the instructions on when and where to wear the device from the study team, and what to do with it afterwards.


## When should I wear the device?

The device will be configured to automatically record data during a specific time interval.  You should wear the device as directed by the study, as it will record data during this period.  The device is designed to be worn continuously.  The enclosure is designed to meet IP68 rating and be suitable for day to day activities including showering and bathing, but should not be worn for more extreme activities such as diving, swimming, or sauna/steam rooms.  You can remove the device after the recording interval, and you will be instructed on what to do with the device after removal.  


## How do I wear the device?

You will be instructed on exactly how the study would like you to wear the device.  


## What should I do if I have any problems with the device?

You will be provided with the best contact details to use as part of the study.  

The device contains a battery and, if the device becomes damaged and/or develops heat, it should be removed immediately and not worn again.
