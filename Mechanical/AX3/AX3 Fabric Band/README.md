**IMPORTANT:** The AX devices are "not a toy" and it must not be possible for an infant or young person to gain access or interact with a device or band that is not properly secured on the wearer.  In particular, the inner sensor puck dimensions are such that it will fit within a "Small Parts Cylinder" that is often used to identify potential choking hazards.  It would be advised to only be used under informed and supervised conditions. In addition, you could consider securing with an attachment that cannot be opened without a tool (similar to a hospital identity bands that must be cut off after use), or somehow securely encased within a larger unit that would not pose a choke hazard.
